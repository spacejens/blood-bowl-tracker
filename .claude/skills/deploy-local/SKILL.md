description: Use to build and start the blood-bowl-tracker stack locally via Docker Compose so a developer can see a change running end-to-end — invoked directly, or offered by develop-feature after a PR is created and by handle-pr-reviews after pushing fixes
---

# deploy-local

Builds and starts the full stack defined in `docker-compose.yml` (the `discord-bot` app and its `postgres` database), confirms both containers come up healthy, and reports how to inspect or tear down the deployment. Leaves containers running — this is a manual-inspection tool, not a one-shot smoke test.

## Invocation

```
/deploy-local
```

Takes no arguments.

## Steps

1. `docker-compose.yml` fixes both container names (`postgres`, `discord-bot`) rather than letting Compose namespace them per project — a stopped container left over from a previous run (in this checkout or any other clone/worktree of this repo) will collide on the name and make step 2 fail with "Conflict. The container name ... is already in use". Check for and clear that first:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a --filter "name=^postgres$" --filter "name=^discord-bot$" --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
   ```
   For each container listed as `Exited`, tell the developer you're removing it before starting fresh, then remove only those (naming just the `Exited` ones — passing a name that doesn't exist errors on "No such container"):
   ```bash
   docker rm <exited-container-name> [<other-exited-container-name>]
   ```
   (only removes the stopped containers — the named `postgres_data` volume and its data are untouched). If either is listed as anything other than `Exited` (i.e. already running), stop and report that to the developer instead of removing it — it may be a deployment they're actively using.
2. Build and start both services in the background:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
3. Poll container status until `postgres` reports healthy and `discord-bot` is `Up` (not `Restarting` or `Exited`):
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```
   Retry every few seconds, up to a reasonable timeout (e.g. 60 seconds). If `discord-bot` is `Restarting` or `Exited`, or `postgres` never reports healthy within the timeout, stop and report the failure along with the relevant `docker compose logs <service>` output.
4. Confirm `discord-bot` connected successfully by checking its logs for the startup notifier's success line, with no fatal error logged first:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs discord-bot
   ```
   Look for a line containing `Posted startup message to channel`. If it's missing after the containers have been up for a few seconds, report what the logs show instead — this usually indicates a missing or invalid Discord token in `apps/discord-bot/.env`.
5. Report to the developer:
   - Which containers are up and their health status.
   - The Postgres connection string for manual inspection: `postgres://blood_bowl:blood_bowl@localhost:5433/blood_bowl` (matches `docker-compose.yml`'s host port mapping).
   - The teardown command: `docker compose down` (add `-v` to also remove the Postgres data volume).
   - That containers are left running for manual inspection — this skill does not tear them down itself.

## Non-goals

- No automated end-to-end smoke test — this is a manual-inspection tool, not a CI gate.
- No teardown — containers are left running until the developer runs `docker compose down` themselves.
